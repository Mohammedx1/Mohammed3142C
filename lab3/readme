This program reports 3 main things. 

1. Pass rate per instructor (and per course number)

2. W rate per instructor (and per course number)

3. Fall vs Spring pass rate for each course (1115, 3115, 3130)

Fall and spring terms are entire based on my opinion as it wasnt clearly stated which term_id was fall & Spring.

Articulation: 
Each term Id was assigned to a certain catagory, either Fall or spring. 
From there each Instructor in 2 of the catagory was then evaluated to find the passing rate. 
After finding the Instrctor passing rate, the course passing rate for 1115,3115,3130 was evaluated for each fall and spring.
Number of withdraws was then found in each catagory and added up the end to give an overall WD per term, per instructor and per course.

A calculator that is able to do +,-,*,/ and SqR

With the help of https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/ and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/calculator-using-classes-in-cpp/

I was able to make a calculator that is able to take in an expression and evaluate it sort of using PEMDAS.
